                        <p>Chennai Super Kings (CSK) are a franchise cricket team based in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. They play in the Indian Premier League (IPL).

The team served a two-year suspension from the IPL starting July 2015 due to the involvement of their owners in the 2013 IPL betting case, and won the title in its comeback season of 2018. The team is captained by MS Dhoni and coached by Stephen Fleming. They are the current defending champions, having won the 2021 IPL season. In January 2022, CSK became India's first unicorn sports enterprise. The Super Kings have won the IPL title five times (in 2010, 2011, 2018, 2021 and 2023), and have the highest win percentage of matches among all teams in the IPL (58.98%). They hold the records of most appearances in the playoffs (Twelve)and the Final (Ten) of the IPL. In addition, they have also won the Champions League Twenty20 in 2010 and 2014. The brand value of the Super Kings in 2019 is estimated to be around ₹732 crore (roughly $104 million), making them one of the most valuable IPL franchises.</p>

                        <p>Mumbai Indians won the 2011 Champions League Twenty20 after beating Royal Challengers Bangalore by 31 runs in the final. The team won the double by winning its first IPL title, in 2013, by defeating Chennai Super Kings by 23 runs in the final, and then defeated the Rajasthan Royals by 33 runs to win its second Champions League Twenty20 title later that year. They won their second IPL title on 24 May 2015 by defeating the Chennai Super Kings by 41 runs in the final and became the third team to win more than one IPL title. On 21 May 2017, they won their third IPL title by defeating the Rising Pune Supergiant by 1 run in a thrilling final, thus becoming the first team to win three IPL titles. While playing the tournament, they won their 100th T20, becoming the first team to do so. In 2019, they repeated the same feat as they won a record breaking fourth IPL title, by beating CSK by just 1 run on 12 May 2019 in the IPL Final. They became the first team to win the IPL title for the fifth time, by beating Delhi Capitals by 5 wickets on 10 November 2020 in the IPL Final.</p>

                        <p>Royal Challengers Bangalore (often abbreviated as RCB) are a franchise cricket team based in Bangalore, Karnataka, that plays in the Indian Premier League (IPL). It was founded in 2008 by United Spirits and named after the company's liquor brand Royal Challenge. Since its inception, the team has played its home matches at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium. The Royal Challengers have never won the IPL but finished runners-up on three occasions between 2009 and 2016. Their lack of success over the years despite the presence of various notable players has earned them the tag of "underachievers". The team holds the records of both the highest and the lowest totals in the IPL - 263/5 and 49 respectively. The brand value of Royal Challengers Bangalore was estimated to be ₹595 crore (US$78 million) in 2019, according to a survey conducted by Duff & Phelps.</p>
